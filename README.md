#Kaggle Competition: Handwritten Digit Recognition
March 2015
The goal for this project is to take an image of a handwritten digit, and identify what that digit is. The data for this project were taken from the MNIST dataset. In this project, python and related packages (numpy, pandas, sklearn, plt) were used to process the data, train the data and predict the results. Two built-in algorithms-k-nearest neighbors and random forest were performed for the predictions.
